He diagnosed the panel and suggested I do a panel upgrade. He flipped the breakers and found one of them arcing with a little flame.  He said he could not leave with electricity connected because of the fire risk. He said he would go home and write up a quote and email it to me that night. His price was so much lower than the quotes I had for a panel replacement.  I agreed to have this done and he said he would order the parts Friday night and pick up the parts Saturday morning and be at my house to do the job around 10:00am.He was here on time and got to work. It took him till about 3:30-4:00pm to complete the job.I highly recommend First Electric for all  your electrical needs.Honest, friendly, and does what he says he will do??MarkBrea CA",

We scheduled an appointment for the following day. He showed up at the precise scheduled time and thoroughly inspected the project and gave me a detailed plan on what was needed. After evaluating several other companies, I decided to go with Michael. His wasn't the most expensive nor cheapest but his professionalism helped make my decision.He pulled the permit and contacted Edison before starting the job. About a week later we scheduled an appointment for installation, most of which was completed the first day. He came back the next to finish up a few things (cleaning the area each day.) He scheduled his patch & repair person in the following days and the final inspection. My only complaint would be that his patch & repair person was not as meticulous about cleaning the area after he finished his job. Otherwise, from start to finish I am pleased with the outcome. I told Michael he's my electrician for life now!! Don't hesitate in hiring him - you won't be disappointed.",

Michael was the only one that came out that same day told us what he could do and gave us a quote. We wanted to change from Florescent to LEDs. He ordered the parts and the following week when the parts came in, he was here and replaced the old lights. The kitchen lights are much brighter and use less wattage. His charge to us (labor and material) was very reasonable and work was done quickly and professionally. Michael has  very pleasant personality and answered any electrical question we had. It was a \"delight\" to have him do the work for us!",
