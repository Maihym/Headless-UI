Add to `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here
```

**How to get the key:**
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Enable **Maps JavaScript API** and **Places API**
3. Create an API key
4. (Optional) Restrict it to your domain

**Note:** The app still works without the API key - autocomplete just won't function, but users can manually type addresses.
